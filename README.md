# [#GOLDTRIBE](https://ctt.ac/5vVnB) supports Gaia Tribe + other charities with metalic-math coins

## These metalic math coins (crowned by the GOLD token) offer novelty as the first Fibbonacci series-infused currency, and holding GOLD offers returns in other metalic chrity coins. (TBA Jun 21, 2021)

100% of the proceeds of our token sale + donations received will go to charity via the [gaialovefund](https://wax.bloks.io/account/gaialovefund). We'll be giving 60% of proceeds to our Peruvian Non-profit (Gaia Tribe NGO) and 40% to other charities + community projects, like permaculture, food forrests, city gardens, etc. The idea is to change some of the bad juju from precious metal extraction to something to help Earth.

# To Moon For Earth

GOLD was created as a means to catalyze re-incorporation of the human collective into the Gaia collective through funding small-scale permaculture projects (we also launched [Perma.rocks](https://perma.rocks)) that bring humans in close contact with nature.

This connecting spirit, including our shared goal of reaching another Moon, ties mathmatically-inspired in tokenomics, and rooted in the amount of real gold on Earth.

# Sell Orders 📈

100% minted supply already sent to Alcor [Market](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/gold-goldgoldgold_wax-eosio.token) + [Swap](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?output=GOLD-goldgoldgold&input=WAX-eosio.token)

[gaialovefund](https://wax.bloks.io/account/gaialovefund). 

This account placed the sell orders [below] except where it would be less than .00000001 WAX per gold, that GOLD was instead placed in a defi [swap](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?output=GOLD-goldgoldgold&input=WAX-eosio.token).

This lead to incredibly [cheap GOLD](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?input=WAX-eosio.token&output=GOLD-goldgoldgold) for early buyers, as was intended by the model. Organizer Douglas bought back 36b (15% Max Supply) of GOLD to donate to gaialovefund, as all the fund's gold was sold in the Fibonacci listings. 

Sell orders are according to the Golden Ratio, as approximated by the Fibonacci series. We used mirrored Fibonacci series (below) to determine the market price of GOLD.
