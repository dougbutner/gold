# [#GOLDTRIBE](https://ctt.ac/5vVnB) supports Permaculture charities with metalic-math coins

## These metalic-math coins (crowned by the GOLD token) offer novelty as the first Fibbonacci series-infused currency. Holding GOLD attracts lunarly gifts in SILVER, and SILVER is a LP rewards token that can be [staked for SILVER rewards](https://r.land/blu) via [Bludac](https://bludac.io). (Details below)

100% of the proceeds of our token sale + donations received will go to charity via the [gaialovefund](https://wax.bloks.io/account/gaialovefund). We'll be giving 100% of proceeds to Permaculture projects, eco-charities + community projects like food forests, city gardens, etc. The idea is to change some of the bad juju from precious metal extraction to something to help Earth. 

> To transmute and regrow, alchemy is employed using sacred-geometric mathematical experimentation.

# To Moon For Earth

GOLD was created as a means to catalyze re-incorporation of the human collective into the Gaia collective through funding small-scale permaculture projects (we also launched [Perma.rocks](https://perma.rocks)) that bring humans in close contact with nature. We hope to remind humanity that we are a living breathing part of the ecosystem, and we are an incredible and abundant living planet. 

This connecting spirit, including our shared goal of reaching another Golden Moon, ties mathmatically-inspired in tokenomics, and rooted in the amount of real gold on Earth. 


## Gold + Silver 🌝🌚

**Golden Moons** celebrate $GOLD token reaching a certain price in WAX. (NFT reward for top holders after 🌕 15)

**Silver Moons** are payments sent out every IRL Full Moon in SILVER to participants in the GOLD economy. First Silver Moon payment went out October, 2021 for the 'Hunter' Full Moon. Rewards are active but still being finalized. You will get some payment every full moon of you have GOLD or GOLDSIL in your account. 

![Silver will show up in your wallet every month if you have GOLD, no claim needed](images/silver-moon-example.png)

![LP rewards were added a few months later](images/gold-moon-example.png)


> New Rewards: We've just added a single-token-staking GOLD to the new model below. As this makes the old system obsolete, we've indefinitely paused all of the old rewards.


# Silver LP Rewards on [bludac.io](https://bludac.io) 

Starting Jan 17, 2022, there will be quarterly (90 day) pools to reward GOLD and SILVER economy participants. These pools will INCREASE in output every year and quarter, creating more long-term stability than a front-loaded LP reward token. Each year the rewards will 4X, then the next year they will restart at 2x the original reward, and 4x again throughout the year. This is planned to continue until all SILVER has been distributed, with the model remaining open to improvements.

| 2022 | Main Reward Pools | Family Pools | Community Pools | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| Q1 | 25,000,000 | 10,000,000 | 5,000,000 |

## Quicksilver Pool 🧙‍♂️🥈

Each period, a final "Stake SILVER for SILVER" pool is added to make the math Magic. This pool is deep and gleaming with SILVER - by the silver ratio of all other period rewards combined. Total reward is is 41.421356237%, 1 / (1 + √2), one over the SILVER ratio.

# The 54 Golden Moons 🧑‍🚀

Golden Moons represent a collective goal - clearing one mirrored Fibonacci sell order. Starting with Moon 16, we'll drop a NFT to the top GOLD economy participants + GOLD holders for each moon we land on. To land on the moon requires reaching above the moon price on the spot market, that is, clearing the sell order the moon represents, and thus raising that much funding.

*last two digits are insignificant until moon 27*

# Sell Orders 📈

100% minted supply already sent to [Alcor Exchange's Spot Market](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/gold-goldgoldgold_wax-eosio.token) + [Swap](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?output=GOLD-goldgoldgold&input=WAX-eosio.token) via the [gaialovefund](https://wax.bloks.io/account/gaialovefund) account. 

This account placed the sell orders [below] except where it would be less than .00000001 WAX per gold, that GOLD was instead placed in the defi [swap](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?output=GOLD-goldgoldgold&input=WAX-eosio.token).

This lead to incredibly [cheap GOLD](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?input=WAX-eosio.token&output=GOLD-goldgoldgold) for early buyers, as was intended by the model, with one fortunate account picking up +30% total supply. Luckily, they dumped early to the swap, and organizer Douglas bought back 36b (15% supply) of GOLD to donate to gaialovefund, and remains the second largest holder behind the fund. 

Because GOLD "started from the bottom" of the possible WAX price, there's been interesting mechanics even early in the experiment.

Sell orders were/are listed according to the Golden Ratio, as approximated by the Fibonacci series. We used mirrored Fibonacci series (below) to determine the market price of GOLD. The length of this series was determined by the total supply of GOLD.

# How is this raising money for permaculture? 🤔🌳
GOLD was released to the public very cheaply, that is, below the minimum spot trading price of 0.00000001 WAX / GOLD. While this didn't help us raise initial funds, it did create a DeFi game that anyone could play for a fraction of a WAX. Currently, the gaialovefund account has 36 billion GOLD that was donated back, and the plan now is to create a win-win-win economy using GOLD and SILVER and list this GOLD slowly on the spot market starting at the price of .00001, giving us over 200k WAX to put towards permaculture. We messed up the fundraising by selling GOLD so cheaply, but we also made an opportunity for more people to benefit in an amazing way. 

# Can SILVER be sold to raise money for permaculture too?
With SILVER, we have another ratio (the SILVER Radio) to honor, and the original plan was to offer SILVER similarly to GOLD on the market using this new ratio.  With the failure of GOLD to raise more than 200 USD, we have decided to keep SILVER as a LP rewards token and decide later if/when there will be a public sale of SILVER. By using SILVER to benefit cXc and GOLD lp, the economy is richer, and this may make a better opportunity to help other projects as well, as [Bludac](https://r.land/blu) has. 

If there is a sale of the final tokens (years away), it will be announced on our [Telegram](https://t.me/ToMoonForEarth) first.  


# Informal Changelog

###  NGO Update 

The legal process wasn't possible for us to secure our NGO in Peru as planned without a physical address, but we are continuing in the direction of permacultural curation organization. We really don't need an NGO to make this happen now (to raise charity funds + donate), but will move forward to a Peruvian NGO once we have land to plant ourselves. 

### The Alchemist 🧙‍♂️✨🌗
GOLD was conceived by [Douglas](https://douglas.life), creator of WAX / HIVE dapp [cXc.world](https://cxc.world). cXc and GOLD are sister projects, and in addition to raising money for Permaculture, GOLD and SILVER serve to enrich the cXc economy through rewarding participants, and visa versa.
